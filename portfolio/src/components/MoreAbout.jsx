            <p>
                I’m Rohan Kasichhwa, a software developer with a strong interest in building practical, data-driven, and scalable
                applications. My primary focus is on machine learning and full-stack web development, with hands-on experience
                using
                Django, React, Scikit-learn, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
            </p>

            <p>
                My machine learning work includes projects such as stock market prediction and loan approval prediction, where I
                focused on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. On the web development side, I have built several
                complete applications, including <b>Best-Reads</b>, an e-commerce bookstore developed with Django and React
                <b>Stock-Pal</b>, a web-based stock market analysis and prediction platform that integrates machine learning
                models
                into a full-stack application and <b>Recipe-Book</b>, a recipe-based social media system built using PHP and
                MySQL.
                I also have experience with Java, JavaScript, and version control workflows using Git. </p>
